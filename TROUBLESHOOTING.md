## Projects

### Project was deleted accidentally
- **Symptoms**: A user removes a project and worries that associated files are lost. They want to recover downloads or upload files.
- **Resolution**: Deleting a project only removes its metadata from Loop in `~/.loop_metadata/projects/<project_id>` folder. downloaded files remain on disk in the project folder and uploads stay in the remote repository.
- **Escalation**: Project metadata recovery is possible from a backup if exists. Nonetheless, the metadata inside a project is not significant enough for the work required to do the restore. It is recommended to create a new project again.

### Rename a project
- **Symptoms**: A user wants to change the autogenerated project name and is unsure where the rename control lives.
- **Resolution**: Click the pencil icon next to the project title on the project detail page to rename it instantly.

### Update the project workspace to a shared folder
- **Symptoms**: The user wants new downloads to land inside a shared folder instead of their default `~/loop_downloads` project workspace.
- **Resolution**: Open the project detail page and press the pencil button in the **Download Files** tab header to choose a different workspace folder. Use the file browser to navigate into the target directory and select it; Loop immediately updates the project to use that path for all future downloads. Existing downloaded files are moved from the original location to the new folder automatically.
- **Escalation**: If the shared folder cannot be selected, ensure the user has write permissions.

### Changing the project folder fails
- **Symptoms**: A user tries to update the project folder in Loop, but the change fails. Error messages mention permissions or files in progress.
- **Resolution**: Project folder cannot be updated if there are download files pending or in progress: Wait until all files are transferred. If there are no ongoing files, ensure that the user has write permissions on the target folder and that the folder exists.
- **Escalation**: If filesystem permissions look correct, check quotas and directory ACLs on that disk partition.

### Beta regression requiring a factory reset
- **Symptoms**: After upgrading Loop, a user reports that previously working projects show errors or stacktraces, or new downloads/uploads never start. Only some accounts are affected, typically ones that already had Loop metadata from a prior beta build.
- **Resolution**: Use **Help → Reset Application** in the Loop navigation menu to wipe the metadata folder for the user. This action is safe but cannot be undone. If the reset dialog is unavailable or the problem persists, instruct the user to manually remove their metadata directory `~/.loop_metadata`. The Projects section on the User Guide describes the purpose of these folders so users understand what will be cleared. Have the user recreate their projects and re-download the files if necessary.

## Downloads

### Files are greyed out and cannot be downloaded
- **Symptoms**: Individual files in a dataset explore view appear disabled or grey, and the download button is unavailable. 
- **Resolution**: This indicates that the files are restricted or under embargo in the remote repository. Or it can also be that its size is higher than `max_download_file_size` which is 10 GB by default. There is additional information about the cause by hovering the mouse over the icon in the greyed out file.
- **Escalation**: `max_download_file_size` can be updated by following the Admin Guide to suport larger files if required. For restricted or embargoed files, collect the file identifier, repository version, and any API responses if the file should be public but remains disabled.

### Where are my downloaded files?
- **Symptoms**: A user triggered a download but cannot locate the data on disk. They expect Loop to provide a link to open the correct directory for them.
- **Resolution**: Download files are organized by project. Identify the project, open its detail page and switch to the **Downloads** tab. The header shows the folder icon that opens the project workspace in the Open OnDemand Files app, pointing to the exact filesystem location for that project's downloads. By default, Loop stores project workspaces under the configured `download_root` application property that defaults to `~/loop_downloads`, so the files will appear in that directory hierarchy.

### How can I copy or move my downloaded files into my shared folder?
- **Symptoms**: After downloading data, the user wants to copy/move the files into a shared directory but does not see a copy/move option inside Loop.
- **Resolution**: If the user wants to use the shared folder as the project workspace, use the pencil button on the **Downloads** tab on the project detail view to change the project folder. All files downloaded onto that project will be moved automatically from the previous folder into the new one. 

If the user wants to copy/move files to the shared folder but continue working on the same Loop workspace, use the Open OnDemand Files application. To open the Files application use the folder button in the **Downloads** tab in the project detail view. Select the files you want to copy, click on Copy/Move, go to the target location and click on the Copy/Move button.
- **Escalation**: If the user cannot reach the target shared directory, confirm the user’s filesystem permissions or disk quotas.

### Download is stuck in the Downloading state
- **Symptoms**: A download file shows `Downloading` indefinitely in the **Downloads** page, even after refreshing it. The system continues to download other files, but the affected file never changes the status. 
- **Resolution**: This could happen if the detached process aborts or the server is shutdown while a file is being downloaded. The file keeps the `downloading` status. On the next detached process start-up, it will only process files in `pending` state. Any other state is ignored, including `downloading`. This scenario is logged in the DownloadService.

To fix the issue ask the user to cancel the download file using the cancel button in the **Downloads** page and use the retry functionality. 
- **Escalation**: If this problem becomes a common occurrance, further investigation will be required to understand why the detached process is failing so often. 

### Download shows an error status
- **Symptoms**: A download displays an `error` badge. The user is unsure what to do next.
- **Resolution**: As a first step, tell the user to retry the download. 

Possible reasons for this error are network connectivity issues, MD5 checksum verification failures, authentication errors on private data downloads or disk space. If the problem persists after retries, check the file event logs in the application to get further information
- **Escalation**: If the problem relates to disk space, ask the user to change the project workspace location. 
If the problem relates to authentication, ask the user to provide the appropriate API key for the related repository. This might solve the issue.

### New downloads fail because storage is full
- **Symptoms**: Selecting files for download immediately display errors with filesystem quota or disk space messages.
- **Resolution**: The application requires to write metadata on the user's home directory. If this directory become full, the application will not be able to schedule new files to download. Ask the user to free disk space on their home directory by deleting unneeded files.

### What happens if I download the same file twice?
- **Symptoms**: Users worry that downloading a file again will overwrite the version already on disk.
- **Resolution**: Loop automatically renames duplicate downloads by appending a numeric suffix (for example, `_01`, `_02`) so each transfer lands alongside the earlier version without overwriting it.

### Restarting a cancelled or failed download
- **Symptoms**: A user cancels a download, or it fails with an error, and they expect an automatic retry that it is not happening.
- **Resolution**: Loop does not automatically retry failed downloads. User needs to click on the **Retry** button on the file row. Alternatively, users can create a new download for the same file to repeat the process. Review the event logs on the file to understand the failure reason.


## Uploads

### Upload shows an error status
- **Symptoms**: A upload displays an `error` badge. The user is unsure what to do next.
- **Resolution**: As a first step, tell the user to retry the upload. 

Possible reasons for this error are network connectivity issues, MD5 checksum verification failures or authentication errors. If the problem persists after retries, check the file event logs in the application to get further information
- **Escalation**: If the problem relates to authentication, ask the user to provide the appropriate API key for the related repository in the **Repository Settings**. This might solve the issue.

### Uploading large files is blocked
- **Symptoms**: Attempting to select a file to upload above a certain size immediately fails. Error messages mention exceeding the configured limit.
- **Resolution**: Loop enforces `max_upload_file_size` for uploads which is 1 GB by default. Suggest splitting the data into smaller archives if possible.
- **Escalation**: `max_upload_file_size` can be updated by following the Admin Guide to suport larger files if required.

### How do I navigate to the remote repository where my files are uploaded?
- **Symptoms**: After uploading files to a dataset, the user wants to verify them on the remote repository but cannot find a direct link from Loop.
- **Resolution**: Open the upload bundle tab used to upload the file on the project detail view. In the repository actions bar identified by the plug icon, there you will see the description of the remote dataset where the files have been uploaded. This description links back to the remote dataset. 

### Restarting a cancelled or failed upload
- **Symptoms**: A user cancels a upload, or it fails with an error, and they expect an automatic retry that it is not happening.
- **Resolution**: Loop does not automatically retry failed uploads. User needs to click on the **Retry** button on the file row. Alternatively, users can create a new upload for the same file to repeat the process. Review the event logs on the file to understand the failure reason.


## Exploring data

### Cannot access a draft dataset
- **Symptoms**: A user reports that exploring a draft dataset shows an authorization error message.
- **Resolution**: Confirm that the dataset version is `draft`. Draft versions require API keys even if the published dataset is public. Ask the user to open **Repositories → Settings** and add a valid API key for the affected repository. API keys saved there automatically apply to browsing and downloads.
- **Escalation**: If an API key is present but the error message still shows, ensure that API key has permissions to explore that dataset. 

### Need to explore a previous dataset version
- **Symptoms**: A user wants to review an earlier version of a dataset but they don't know how.
- **Resolution**: OnDemand Loop supports exploring multiple versions on a dataset. Load the dataset via the **Explore** workflow. Use the dataset version selector, the plus button on the right hand side of the dataset description section, to select another version. Please note that due to API restrictions, only the last 10 versions are displayed. 

### Quickly reopen frequently accessed datasets
- **Symptoms**: The user repeatedly searches for the same dataset even though they recently explored it in Loop. They are unaware of a shortcut to reopen the dataset directly.
- **Resolution**: Point them to the folder icon next in the the Explore bar next to the **Explore** button. Clicking it opens the **Repository Activity** dialog, which lists recently browsed datasets. From the list you can explore the datasets or open the remote repository website.

### User doesn't know that datasets are paginated
- **Symptoms**: Only the first batch of files is displayed when viewing datasets. Pagination controls show that more files exist, but the user is unaware of them.
- **Resolution**: Explain that Loop paginates file listings based on the configured default page size (20 items by default). Use the pagination controls in the dataset explorer to load additional pages of files. 
- **Escalation**: For installations that regularly handle very large datasets, administrators can raise `default_pagination_items` so more files appear per page.

### Update or delete a saved repository API key
- **Symptoms**: A user needs to rotate credentials or remove repository access after leaving a project but cannot find where saved API keys live.
- **Resolution**: API keys are stored globally in repository settings and locally in Upload Bundles. 
Open **Repositories → Settings** to view every repository Loop has stored. From this page you can edit the existing API key value or delete the entire repository entry, which clears the stored credentials and any connector-specific settings. Updating the key takes effect immediately — no restart is required. 
Review related Upload Bundles to update the required locally-stored API keys.
- **Escalation**: Globally-stored API keys are stored in `~/.loop_metadata/repos/repo_db.yml` file. Upload Bundle's API keys are stored inside the upload bundle metadata file which is stored in `~/.loop_metadata/projects/<project-id>/upload_bundles/<upload-bundle-id>/metadata.yml`.

### DOI or dataset URL does not work in the Explore bar
- **Symptoms**: Pasting a DOI or dataset URL results in an error message. The user may be unsure which formats are accepted.
- **Resolution**: Confirm the identifier matches a supported format (for example, `doi:10.7910/DVN/MYSRMN`, `https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MYSRMN`, `doi:10.5281/zenodo.4884775`, `https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4884775`, or a full HTTPS dataset URL like `https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FMYSRMN&version=1.0`). Ensure that this DOI is linked to a supported dataset and that the repository is supported and accessible from the current environment. You can check that the DOI is linked to a valid repository on the section **Try resolving a DOI name** of `https://www.doi.org` website. If the dataset is draft, ensure you add the required API key before retrying.
- **Escalation**: Collect the full identifier and any console errors if supported formats still fail.

### Repository compatibility issues
- **Symptoms**: Users can authenticate to a Dataverse installation, but searches, downloads, or uploads fail immediately with connector errors. Alternatively, selecting a Dataverse installation fails or shows incomplete results. Search requests time out or return API compatibility errors.
- **Resolution**: Loop is validated against recent Dataverse releases. Deployments that predate the 6.x series (for example, 4.20 or 5.x) are only partially supported and may break core operations. Confirm the Dataverse version with the repository administrator. If it falls in the “Partial Support” or “Testing Pending” range, document the failure, collect API responses if possible, and escalate to the Loop team. 

## Accessibility

### Keyboard navigation and accessibility
- **Symptoms**: Users rely on keyboard navigation or assistive technologies and want to interact without a mouse. They are unsure whether the upload file selector supports keyboard controls.
- **Resolution**: The file selector supports keyboard navigation for browsing directories and staging files. Users can select entries using arrow and tab keys and activate them with Enter instead of drag and drop.

### Drag and drop does not work for uploads
- **Symptoms**: Dragging files into the upload drop zone does nothing. The user may be on a browser that restricts drag-and-drop events.
- **Resolution**: Advise the user to double-click files in the selector to stage them or rely on keyboard navigation, both of which are fully supported alternatives.

## Others

### Automatic sync is not available
- **Symptoms**: The user asks how to keep a project in sync with a remote repository automatically, or they report that new revisions never appear locally unless they take manual action.
- **Resolution**: Explain that OnDemand Loop performs discrete transfers only. Each upload or download must be triggered manually. Downloads and uploads must be re-queued whenever content changes; there is no background synchronization process. 

### Critical outage caused by infrastructure or environment
- **Symptoms**: The UI loads but project creation fails, existing projects disappear, or downloads/uploads never start. Background job status indicators stay idle despite queued work.
- **Diagnosis**: Loop stores its state on disk. If the metadata directory becomes unavailable or read-only, the application cannot persist project definitions, repository settings, or transfer queues. Similarly, if the download workspace is missing, newly scheduled downloads will fail immediately.
- **Resolution**: Verify that the paths configured for `metadata_root` and `download_root` exist and are writable by the affected user account (they are usually `~/.loop_metadata` and `~/loop_downloads` directories). Restore the storage mount or adjust filesystem permissions as needed. Restart the Loop Passenger app after the storage is restored so cached configuration is reloaded. Ask the user to refresh the browser and retry the action. If the directories were deleted, recreate them and copy any available backups of the `~/.loop_metadata` tree before restarting services.

### Restarting a cancelled or failed transfer
- **Symptoms**: A user cancels a download or upload, or it fails with an error, and they want to retry it. They expect an automatic retry button but cannot find one.
- **Resolution**: Loop does not automatically retry failed transfers. User needs to click on the **Retry** button on the file row. Alternatively, you can start another download or upload to repeat the process. Review the **Events** log on the file to understand the failure reason before retrying.

### Transfers never start processing
- **Symptoms**: Files stay in `pending  ` state and the progress bar never appears. The header on the Downloads or Uploads page shows a paused status.
- **Resolution**: Check the **Job Status** icon on the left of the global Downloads or Uploads pages. A pause icon indicates that no background worker is running. If paused, an administrator should restart the Loop application or background job service so transfers can resume. Verify that the metadata and download directories are writable. Check the lock file `~/.loop_metadata/detached.process.lock` which is necesary to only run a transfer process (The lock file location is described in the Admin Guide with the env variable `OOD_LOOP_DETACHED_PROCESS_FILE`). Try to delete that file to see if the transfer process starts again.

### Where are the log files located?
- **Symptoms**: Support staff need to inspect Loop logs but are unsure where the application writes them for a given user.
- **Resolution**: Each user has a metadata directory (configured via `metadata_root`, `~/.loop_metadata` by default) that holds Loop’s internal state as well as log outputs of `launch_detached_process.log`. Access the project metadata folder from the project detail page to open this directory in the Files app when you need to review this content. Apart from that, nginx application logs for this user are located in `/var/log/ondemand-nginx/<user>/error.log` and the global logs for Apache in `/var/log/httpd/`.
